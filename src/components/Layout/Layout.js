                    <p>Hello and I hope you're well.</p>
                    <p>I know a lot of my patients will be concerned about a second national lockdown, however the clinic will remain OPEN as Osteopaths are allowed to continue to work due to our key worker status.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to offer you reassurance that the clinic is a safe place to come for treatment. Strict adherence to guidelines regarding PPE will be continued â€“ all of which we have been doing since re-opening in May.</p>
                    <p>For patients who have appointments booked, these will only be changed at your request.</p>
                    <p>For patients who are facing shielding, I am able to now announce the arrival of the Kibworth Osteopaths Virtual Clinic. This will include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A consultation with me over zoom or telephone.</li>
                        <li>Any exercises being emailed out to you as well as summary of the consultation.</li>
                        <li>Any follow up appointments being booked.</li>
                        <li>The cost of a KOVC appointment is Â£25.00.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please contact me for any further information.</p>
                    <p>Stay safe,</p>
