                            para2="This is why in 2019, Emily trained with HFE to become a Pilates instructor, and qualified in 2020 as a Pre/Post natal Pilates instructor."
                        >
                            <p>Emily can honestly say she loves her job. No two days are ever the same - one day her youngest patient was 9 days old, and the oldest was 99 years old! Emily finds it a privilege when people say 'help', as she understands that this can take courage, and requires trust in her.</p>
                            <p>Emily is married to her best friend who is superman to her. In 2011 they began their greatest adventure when she had their son, closely followed by their daughter in 2012. Being a parent opened her eyes to a new world, which is when she trained in Cranial Osteopathy, as well as learning a huge amount about treating pregnant patients.</p>
                            <p>In her spare time, Emily is either outside with her family and dogs, walking or camping, or she is curled up with a book and her cat!</p>

                            <p>Kaitlin has a lot of experience in working with patients with more complex histories, particularly those with chronic pain or chronic medical conditions that cause musculoskeletal symptoms.</p>
                            <p>Kaitlin is very personable and prides herself in being able to understand the individual requirements of each patient and being able to adapt various methods of treatment to integrate with their daily life, forming an effective partnership between patient and practitioner and aiding them in achieving their optimum health and wellbeing.</p>
                            <p>Outside of osteopathy, Kaitlin enjoys dancing, cooking, baking, painting and spending time with her family and friends.</p>
