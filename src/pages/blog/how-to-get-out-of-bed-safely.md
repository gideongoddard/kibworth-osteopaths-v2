With a mind on spinal health, we’re going to look at the lower back today, specifically the lower five vertebrae. What I’m going to teach you is a handy way of getting out of bed in the mornings.

So many of us, when we wake up, will just spring forwards and try to get out of bed - that’s not so great! Here’s what I want you to think about if you have a lower back issue or maybe if you’re pregnant:

<ol>
    <li>Shuffle to the edge of the bed on your side and with your knees just over the edge.</li>
    <li>Take the palm of whichever hand is on the side of your body that’s facing upwards and place it on the bed.</li>
    <li>As you push upwards with that hand, lower your feet off the bed so that you’re using the weight of your lower legs and the force through your arm in tandem.</li>
</ol>

This will keep the lower back nice and straight and avoid any unnecessary strain going through it. So give that a practice! Watch the video above where I walk you through this.
