I travel around the world in a day in my clinic.

Hearing about your upcoming and past travels and adventures – I love it!

From world cruises to a quick city weekend break, I really enjoy hearing about the places you visit; my travel list is always growing!

Sometimes, though, I see holiday injuries. As you may guess, some of these can be obvious, from ski accidents to stumbles, and are arguably unavoidable.

Most of the holiday-induced physical trauma I see, however, is possibly preventable with a little bit of consideration.

All holidays/mini-breaks begin with a journey. For me, this is part of the holiday as the excitement builds as you get further from home and closer to your destination.

### Long drives and journeys

Long drives, though, can really cause shoulder and lower back inflammation – so I advise breaking up a drive every 2 hours, just for 5 minutes.

Park up, go for a little walk and off you go again. The advice is similar for a flight – get up and walk the length of the plane, especially if you’re going long haul.

Even if you are sitting next to someone grumpy – move your body.

If you plan on reading/playing on your phone, remember the 20, 20, 20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look away for a distance of 20 yards for 20 seconds. This is good for your neck and eyes.

So, you’ve survived the journey and are ready to enjoy your well-earned break!

### City break

Active city break holidays often involve some walking, so make sure you’re in trainers.

No cute flat shoes with zero support; they will only leave your feet sore and your calf muscles tight.

Likewise, avoid the heels, too!

Also, consider using a backpack for the days out. These are a lot better for you than one shoulder bag, as the weight is distributed evenly across your body.

### Beach holiday

Is a beach bum holiday more your thing? Flip flops are, in my opinion, poolside only. If you have a walk from your hotel/apartment to the beach – don’t do it in flip flops; get some airy, supportive sandals and off you trot!

Don’t be tempted to sit poolside/beachside all day and physically set. Break up your relaxation with a walk in the water (this is so good for your muscles as they work against the resistance of the water) or a swim (if you’re happy to do so).

And as Baz Luhrmann said, “…wear sunscreen!”.

### Active holiday

This is very much my family’s style! The Coombes family loves action, and it could be camping, boarding, and seeing how far we can walk in a day.

I love this holiday style and could waffle on forever about it.

If you camp, invest in a decent air bed – your back will thank you.

Get a decent backpack with a waist strap, and make sure it is right for your frame.

Get good walking boots or trainers, and don’t forget the socks you wear are equally as important.

Active holidays (including ski trips) should also include a warm-up before you start your activity and a good stretch at the end of the day.

Lastly, if you know your neck needs the pillow you love from home, take it with you!
