### Book Review: Glucose Revolution - The life-changing power of balancing your blood sugar by Jessie Inchauspé.

It feels at times really chuffing hard to keep yourself healthy.

Information regarding your health, especially dietary advice, is flying at us in all directions.

Much of the information can be misleading and, at best, contraindicating the last piece of advice you read.

So, Jessie Inchauspé’s book is a voice of calm in a sea of noise, offering clear, understandable and well-researched explanations.

I say ‘explanation’ deliberately over advice, as once you understand the research, what Inchaupsé says makes absolute sense.

This is all about flattening your glucose curves stopping those peaks and corresponding crashes.

Jessie Inchauspé takes the time to ensure that her readers understand precisely what glucose is, how it works in our body, why we need it, and how/where we store it.

Inchauspé breaks down many misconceptions around glucose, especially fructose – you don’t need that glass of orange juice!

She also outlines the true importance of fibre and where best to source your fibre.

This book does not make you feel bad about treats, whether you want them or consume them. Jessie Inchauspé makes no secret of her love of chocolate.

Instead, this is about how to eat and what to do to help your body understand what you give it and make the most of what you eat on the inside (who knew vinegar was your friend?!).

Calorie counting is not on Inchauspé’s list of recommendations – but the stories of health success (documented in this book and on Inchauspés Instagram @glucosegoddess) from following the tips in this book often result in weight loss.

I really loved the inclusion of recipes, as you can get going straight away, often with what you have in the fridge and cupboards.

I have to be truthful — this book changed how I structure my work days.

Before, I would snack throughout the day, which caused constant glucose spikes and crashes. Now, I stop, make time for lunch, and I cannot tell you how much better I feel. That 3 p.m. wall is gone!

This book is a great, informative read. The science is easy to follow, as are the hacks that Inchauspé gives her readers.

This book should be taught to everyone from a young age.

The effects of glucose running around your body are staggering and concerning, from inflammation, cravings, acne, wrinkles, type 2 diabetes, and even cancer and dementia. For all of these conditions and diseases, glucose is a common denominator.

Since reading Glucose Revolution, I have lost count of how many times I have recommended people read it and implement the tips in their lives.

After reading Glucose Revolution, I have installed many of Jessie Inchauspé’s “hacks” - although I  have not yet tried the vinegar except on salad!

I now eat the food on my plate in the correct order (veggies first, people, then proteins, then starch). I am also curbing my snacking and moving after eating. Her suggestions are so simple and easy to install into your life.

As a family, we have totally stopped eating breakfast cereals. From now on, breakfast is a savoury breakfast in Casa Coombes, which the kids and adults love!

I have noticed a huge difference in my children (who are 12 and 11 years old at the time of this writing); they are fuller for longer, for starters.

For me, I have more energy, a clearer mind, and more determination than ever to help my patients with all aspects of their health.
