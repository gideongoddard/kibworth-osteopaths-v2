<h4>This is possibly a controversial title - but it got your attention!</h4>

It really saddens me when I hear patients say ‘I have Sciatica’ with a tone of final acceptance.

The thing is, Sciatica in its own right is not a diagnosis – it is a symptom that your sciatic nerve (by the way we have one on each side) is being irritated.

WHY your sciatic nerve is irritated, that is your diagnosis. Sciatic symptoms typically include pain/pins and needles/numbness or weakness into your leg (sometimes both legs are affected).

Osteopaths always look for the route cause of any injury – this way we are more likely to be effectivein our treatment, advice and rehabilitation.

There is no denying that whatever the cause of Sciatica (be it spinal or non-spinal) it is painful, debilitating, frustrating, and can be chronic.

Osteopaths understand this, and our goal is to get you pain free (or as near as possible).

I’m not ever going to say Osteopathy can cure all that ails us, but what I can personally promise is that I never stop searching for the reason my patients have their symptoms, and where needed, I refer and request further tests. Above all, I will always act as my patient&#39;s advocate.

It&#39;s vital that a patient understands why they have their symptoms, this helps with self management, as well as providing a pathway to restoring confidence in their body, and their physical abilities.

And this is what I am all about, spring boarding you into better health.

Patients are often really surprised that despite seeing me, and because they are experiencing pain, treatment does not hurt. My goal is to help you, not hurt you. The old adage of ‘no pain no gain’ has no welcome in my clinic.

<h4>So what about that Sciatica? How can Osteopathy help?</h4>

Well firstly, work out WHY the symptoms are there.

Secondly we work to calm down the irritation around the sciatic nerve using gentle hands on treatment, sports tape where appropriate, and provide relevant effective advice regarding the use of ice or heat.

Safe and effective gentle exercises are also provided. The next stage is where my Pilates knowledge is then utilised, since part of my job as an Osteopath is injury prevention.

How do we keep a patient in good form? Well, once symptoms are much quieter, strengthening the area is key.

So there we have it, next time you or someone you know states they have Sciatica, challenge them
on this, ask them what is causing the symptoms – then the journey to recovery can start.
