### Book Review: Managing Your Migraine, Dr Katy Munro.

---

Migraine is something I see a fair amount as an Osteopath.

Migraine is also something that affects my family. My dad has them, I get them, and what breaks my heart is my daughter (aged 11 at the time of writing) does too. There is a genetic link with migraine.

However, they do not present the same way in my family. I was keen to learn more about what is out there to help professionals who interact with migraine sufferers, as well as what I could learn to help my daughter, myself and maybe even my dad (a retired GP). And along popped this gem of a book.

One in seven people suffer from Migraine. Migraine is debilitating, misunderstood and often misdiagnosed. Migraine is more than a headache – it is a neurological disorder that can have a huge impact on the sufferer's quality of life. It causes days off work and days off school.

Getting to know your migraine is utterly essential to help you manage it. From ensuring strict sleeping patterns to knowing your triggers and understanding what is available to help you with regards to medication, as well as alternative therapies – all of this and more will help you live WITHOUT migraine.

Dr Munro explains what the common triggers are (thank the stars above chocolate as a trigger is a myth for most migraine sufferers!) and suggests good, implementable management strategies.

This book is packed full of fantastic resources – the migraine diary available for FREE from the [National Migraine Centre - specialist migraine clinic](https://www.nationalmigrainecentre.org.uk/) is something I now recommend to my migraine patients. This is just one example of the fantastic charities out there that can help and support migraine sufferers and their families – and Dr Munro lists them ALL.

Dr Munro also discusses in huge detail the types of medication available and how they can influence migraine – hopefully stopping the migraine snowball from becoming a rolling avalanche- giving the reader good knowledge and understanding of what pharmaceuticals could be an option for them.

Also discussed is the role of hormones and their interaction with migraine (this is not just a chapter for women!)—and what can be done to help—linking to another great book published by Penguin Life Experts, Preparing for the Perimenopause and Menopause by Dr Louise Newson.

Knowing what rights individuals have in the workplace when they have migraine and what support can be easily provided for them is heavily discussed and well resourced. It will help employers really help their employees.

Migraines can stop fun days out, cause rifts in relationships, and ask children to care for their parent/caregiver, who is perhaps temporarily unable to provide care for them. They are responsible for a whopping 86 million lost workdays per year in the UK and cost the economy £9.7 billion a year. They can lead to low self-confidence and feeling like you are not in control of your body.

If you or someone you love is a migraine warrior and this book is not on your/their shelf, please get it.

There isn’t one word in this book that is not useful, and you will gain the knowledge to empower you to ensure you get the best possible help in managing your migraine. And definitely check out Dr. Munro’s excellent podcast Heads Up—another resource that provides support and information to help you.
