Osteopaths are trained to diagnose and treat injuries from head to toe in all ages, however the most common injury I see in the clinic is lower back (lumbar spine) injuries.

This includes lower backs that may have been injured through sport, gardening, accidents (for example road traffic collisions or at work), or perhaps old injuries that grumble away but are becoming increasingly more problematic and therefore limiting your activity.

Lower back pain is miserable. It affects how much we can physically do, our confidence in being active, and can even cause sleep disruption.

Osteopaths understand this and are highly trained in diagnosing what the most likely reason is for the patient’s injury, pain and how to treat it.

Not all lower back problems are suitable for Osteopathy.

Osteopaths can spot this as a very detailed case history is taken from the patient and if we feel further diagnostic tests are needed we contact your GP to request these.

An Osteopath knows the human body in huge detail which means you are safe in our hands.

My approach to treating any lower back problem is well refined after more than 12 years in clinical practice, as well as being a Pilates instructor.

I take a <strong>4 Step</strong> approach with my patients, and it really is a partnership between the hands on skills of the Osteopath, and the patient following the advice.

After a detailed examination and all findings discussed and explained to my patient, this is then what happens when the treatment process starts:

<h3>Step 1 - Support the injury</h3>

This may include the use of sports tape (which actually requires a huge amount of skill to correctly apply.

The tape I use is also hypo-allergenic, 100% waterproof and can safely stay on for 5 days), or in more serious injuries the use of a lower back support.

I also provide a lot of specific advice, such as the use of an ice or heat pack, work posture advice, or advice time off work (especially for those in manual jobs).

All advice is emailed out as there is a lot to remember.

<h3>Step 2 - Stabilise the injury</h3>

This is where my skills as an Osteopath and a Pilates instructor blend together.

Stabilising around the injury means to work with safe and effective hands on treatment to calm the deepest muscles and ligaments around the lower back.

I then prescribe appropriate exercises which are subtle but remarkably effective and should not cause pain.

<h3>Step 3 - We Stretch</h3>

Lots of structures are recruited by the body to compensate for and shield an injured lower back.

The level of compensation varies but is larger in more serious injuries and more long standing (chronic) complaints. Again here I utilise both my Osteopathy and Pilates skills.

<h3>Step 4 - We Strengthen</h3>

Strengthening the lower back is a must, but also around the back too. 

Often the big powerful gluteals (bottom muscles) will benefit from this as well as the core. 

I may even suggest to patients we now stop hands on treatment and have a few Pilates sessions to get the injury well and truly under the patient’s control.

Steps 3 and 4 are done in the clinic with effective and safe hands on treatment, as well as with the prescription of tailored exercise programmes for patients to do at home which is emailed.

The exercises are increased over time as the pain decreases and do not exclusively focus on the lower back.

Lots of other structures are needed to be intrinsically strong to support the lower back – especially if it is recovering from an injury – for example the core.
