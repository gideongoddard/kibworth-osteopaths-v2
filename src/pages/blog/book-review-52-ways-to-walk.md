### Book Review: 52 Ways to Walk, Annabel Streets.

*"Walking is so much more than putting one foot in front of the other"*

---

As someone who loves walking, I was intrigued by this book. And, as someone who loves the human body, I was doubly intrigued.

When I stumbled upon this book, I thought surely there is one way to walk, you simply put one foot in front of another and off you go.

I was wrong and will never walk the same way again now that I have read this fascinating text.

Walking is so much more than putting one foot in front of the other.

The benefits for our physical body go far beyond movement, balance and strength, and the mental benefits are hugely underrated.

I learnt of the (scientifically proven) benefits of walking in a pine forest for reducing inflammation in the body or near fast-moving water for negative ions (again proved by science!) and how even a 12-minute walk can hugely benefit us.

Another surprise discovery was that walking under a full moon (which I regularly do as I love the moon) can really charge us, as can walking like a nomad using their ancestral breathing techniques, allowing them to cover huge distances in a day with little fatigue.

In her well researched and hugely informative book, Annabel Streets educates her readers on how to walk and why we all should walk – in different weathers, environments, and altering intentions.

This is what the human body is designed to do, walk. On different terrains, with the breeze in our hair, sun on our skin and earth beneath our feet.

Our 600 muscles are designed to move, reach, and stretch, and our bones are perfectly designed to be loaded and move.

However, modern life has us sitting more than ever, leading to many potential problems with both the physical and mental body.

We must resist the temptation to do less physically and instead encourage ourselves to be more active – not all day but every day and outside.

This book will breathe life into your body and mind and encourage you to open your eyes to our beautiful world.

As an Osteopath I regularly recommend my patients to go for a walk as part of their rehabilitation.

Now I will also suggest that you read this book to understand why this simple (FREE!!!!) form of exercise is vital.

I think it will overwhelmingly encourage you to pop on some boots and get moving!
