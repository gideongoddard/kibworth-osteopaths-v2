### Book Review: Exercised – The Science of Physical Activity, Rest and Health, by Daniel Lieberman.

*"Endlessly fascinating and full of surprises. Easily one of my books of the year."*

\- Bill Bryson.

Daniel Lieberman is a leading figure in the field of human evolution and its relevance to health.
 
‘Exercised’ is a deep dive into how humans are designed to move and the benefits of this.

This entertaining read also explains how we as humans are innately hardwired to choose rest over spending precious calories on unnecessary movements.

However, as humans are becoming increasingly sedentary, the effects of this on the body are huge – and can cause early death amongst many other conditions.

Lieberman explores many types of exercises, asking the question of how much and what type of exercise is best. Myths around running ruining knees are busted, as well as exploring the importance of exercising as we age.

Exercise in children is explored.

Multiple studies show that children should have an hour a day of physical activity – it is sad that many don’t due to screens and long school days where academia is often prioritised over exercise (despite us knowing that performance is improved when children exercise!).

We also know that active children tend to carry on this good habit into their adult life.

Lieberman looks at the benefits and what type of exercise to do for the most prevalent medical issues of our time: obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 Diabetes, respiratory tract infections, chronic musculoskeletal conditions, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and mental health and anxiety.

The reassuring reoccurring theme is that it is NEVER too late to start and that even starting exercise in older years still benefits the body.

Exercise may not be an elixir, but stimulating growth, maintenance, and repair reduces our susceptibility to many diseases.

In this sense, exercise is medicinal, and unlike many medicines, exercise is free and can be fun.

In short, there is rarely a downside to exercise.

Yes, you may be prone to musculoskeletal trauma (this is why your favourite osteopath is right here, happy to help you!), but in short, the benefits will always outweigh the risks.

Daniel Lieberman’s perspectives are fascinating, informative, and persuasive whether you are a fan of exercise or happily avoiding it. Like I have said for many years, ‘Movement is Medicine!’.
