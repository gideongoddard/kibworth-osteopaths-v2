Goal setting in life is important, and we can use them for many different areas of life, from health, fitness, financial, business and many more.

Having goals or a plan has been proven to help maintain focus and help us achieve the goal.

January is often a time for goal setting, so I thought I would offer some top tips for setting physical goals for your health and body.

Both in the clinic, and with my Pilates clients, I use S.M.A.R.T. Goals – and they work well.

You can obviously set a goal at any time of the year. It doesn't have to be January!

<h2>S.M.A.R.T. breaks down into:</h2>

<strong>S</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline">Specific</span> - streamline your goal. What do you want to achieve and why? This is important as there may be times where motivation drops, or injury occurs. Keeping the ‘why am I doing this’ at the forefront of your mind will help you get through the days where your get up and go has got up and gone!

<strong>M</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline">Measurable</span> - how are you going to measure your achievements? I recommend a stepping stone approach – you may need to achieve ‘smaller goals’ to reach your ‘end goal’.  For example, if you wanted to start running and your end goal is to run a half marathon, you may start with ‘Couch to 5K’, and from there 5K to 10K.

<strong>A</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline">Achievable</span> - make your goal attainable not impossible. This also includes looking at potential ‘blocks’ to your goal. It is useful to assess these blocks with a professional (with physical ‘blocks’ you may discuss them with an Osteopath, or personal trainer for example) as they could be moveable! If they are a ‘true block’ there may be a way of moving around it with some adaptation.

<strong>R</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline">Realistic</span> - be aware of your limitations (physical and other commitments such as work, children etc.) and the time you want to achieve your goal in – failure to do this could lead to injury which can set you back.

<strong>T</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline">Time-based</span> - over what time scale do you want to achieve your goal? Bigger challenges often have more steps on the way – allow yourself the time! If you are working to a specific date, make sure you have a schedule – this also boosts your morale as you achieve the steps on the way to the end goal.

It is never too late to use S.M.A.R.T. goals.

Be it walking unaided round the block after a joint replacement, or running a marathon, I am here to help you reach those goals.

With hands-on treatments, tailor made exercise programmes, over 12 years of experience, and a refusal to see you quit I will be by your side every step of the way, encouraging you and celebrating with you when you smash it!
