### Book Review: Wintering, Katherine May.

---

*"The power of rest and retreat in difficult times"*

---

We all Winter at some point in our lives – often, this season has nothing to do with nature’s physical season. Life happens. 

Sometimes we Winter due to circumstances, mental health or both. Katherine May, in her beautiful book Wintering, explores what this means and how to come through this often feared season. 

The importance of recognising your Winter coming and inaction is gently explored, alongside how to look after yourself in this season deeply and why this is a must.

A lot happens in nature’s winter, although this is often invisible to us as it happens within or underground. It is the season of quiet rest, protection and restoration. 

Nature is silently getting ready for Spring. This is what we are gently encouraged to do by Katherine May in our personal Winters.

This is not another self-help book that lectures the reader to “cheer up”, “force yourself happy”, or to “follow these steps and all will be ok”.

Rather this is the book that lets you know to Winter is essential, it will happen to us all at some point.

To go with your Winter will lead to a Spring, where we emerge more knowledgeable, wiser, and more deeply connected to ourselves.

We come out changed, knowing that Winter will probably come again but seeing the value of this season, not the fear.

This is a moving, comforting read that seems to slow the world down.

Permission to feel the ebb and flow of life is quietly encouraged and granted.

With some laugh out loud moments, and relatable life experiences, I really do recommend this utterly gorgeous book to all.

Winter will come to us all at some point.

Recognising it and knowing how to move yourself through this quiet season gently is only ever going to help you, and perhaps give you the understanding of supporting another person through their Winter.
