Nobody wants a Christmas spoiled by musculoskeletal pain or stress. My top tips for avoiding turning into the Grinch are:

1. Get organised! Leaving things to the last minute can place a huge amount of stress on our shoulders which can cause tight muscles and headaches.
2. If you are shopping physically return to the car regularly to avoid carrying heavy or big items for longer than needed. If you are shopping online take regular breaks so you avoid tech-neck.
3. Don’t wrap those gifts on the floor – use a table and sit on a chair.
4. Break up any long drives -  I recommend a break every 90 minutes for 5 minutes.
5. Don’t put up with those uncomfortable niggles, book in with your favourite osteopath.
6. Christmas can be a really busy period – make time for self care for example a long relaxing bath.
7. If you suffer from neck pain/shoulder pain/headaches and you have a specific pillow you use to help combat this, take it away with you if you’re staying away overnight.
8. Stay active! Christmas can dominate your diary, keep exercise plans in place and remember movement is medicine.
9. Be really careful when lifting hot heavy things out of the oven especially if you have a painful back. Take your time, use your knees (if you have a low oven) and your core. If you need to ask for help!
10. If you are under pressure to meet Christmas deadlines do not be tempted to stop your good habits of regular breaks and leaving your desk at lunch. You will be more productive if you keep these things in place.
11. Don’t feel the pressure of saying yes to things you don’t want to do, for example work that extra shift or attend a Christmas party. It is more than ok to say no!
12. I am working between Christmas and New Year for emergency appointments. You can book online [here](/appointments).
