Winter is most certainly in the air and I thought I would make a different sort of a Blog this time, one that focuses on warmth and nourishment on the inside.

I am a big believer in home cooked food but I also know how many of my patients find that this is the time of year we all crave more comforting, and possibly less healthy choices in our diet.

I thought I would share one of my family's fool proof, easy peasy and comforting recipes.

My family LOVE thisSausage Pie and it is super easy to turn vegetarian for me.

A nice, simple, no frills winter dish which I hope you enjoy as much as we do.

<h3>You will need</h3>

- Deep ceramic oven dish
- 8 Sausages (meat or vegetarian)
- 400ml-600ml gravy (adjust according to preference and quantity)
- 6-8 sweet potatoes (depending on size and how many you’re cooking for)
- Spring onions (optional)
- Grated cheese

Oven cook your sausages, and get the sweet potatoes peeled, chopped, boiled and mashed (use a bit of butter and milk).

When the sausages are cooked, chop them into rounds and place back in the oven dish, pour over the gravy until all your sausage rounds are just covered.

Carefully place your sweet potato mash on the top with the chopped spring onions if using and grated cheese.

Place the oven dish in the oven for 15-20 mins whilst steaming veggies of your choice to accompany (I like a ‘rainbow plate’, so we have peas, sweetcorn, broccoli and carrots).
