## The KOPI Book CLUB!

As an Osteopath, I specialise in the bio-mechanics of the beautiful human body. I am the eternal student of the body, an absolute privilege.

My book reviews are written to help you better understand and nurture your physical body. I hope you enjoy reading them, and if you have any books to suggest, I would be very interested to [hear about them](mailto:info@kibworthosteopaths.co.uk).

### Book Review: The Science of Living - 219 reasons to rethink your daily routine by Dr Stuart Farrimond.

The first thing to say about this book is that it is beautifully laid out.

The bright yellow cover alone is like a ray of sunshine on your bookshelf — although you will NOT want to leave this book on the shelf!

It can also be on your coffee table.

Read a page and come back to it later. With a fact or question on each page, the information is not overly wordy, meaning you can learn about your unique body quickly! This is not to say that what Dr Farrimond is writing about is simple – far from it!

Dr. Farrimond starts at the beginning of the day, walking the reader through good morning routines and their importance.

The reader then moves on to the rest of the day, looking at the best time to have meetings, the ideal commute time (spoiler alert: 15 minutes!), and what is a good evening routine.

It also provides impressive facts. For example, if you drink your first coffee in the first hour of waking, you may as well pour it down the drain as your body is running on cortisol now.

And what about when to brush your teeth – before or after breakfast?

This book answers many questions about the body and provides detailed explanations in a fun, easily absorbed way. There are also a lot of age-old beliefs politely blown out of the water and backed up by solid science.

Dr. Farrimond’s book encourages and helps us examine our lives from every angle—I mean every angle—to help us all live healthier and arguably happier lives.

From shopping tips (this was useful!) to workout tips, there is a page for everyone in this book. It was written by a medic to be read by non-medics, which makes it enjoyable and accessible to all—even my young teens enjoyed dipping in and out of it.
