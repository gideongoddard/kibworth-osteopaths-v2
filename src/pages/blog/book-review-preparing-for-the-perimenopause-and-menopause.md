You can always tell a good book when it is dog-eared and coffee stained!

This book is a gift to women from the incredible Dr Louise Newson.

The information in this book is essential for all women to know.

This book will empower women regarding what to expect symptom-wise, what treatments are available, and how to request appropriate help for perimenopausal symptoms/menopausal symptoms.

Sadly these symptoms, when viewed in isolation, not as a collective, can lead to misdiagnosis and/or treatments that will not help.

My advice â€“ ladies - is to read this and share it with every female family member / friend / colleague you know.
