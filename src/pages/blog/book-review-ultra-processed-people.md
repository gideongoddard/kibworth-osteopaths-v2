Dr Chris van Tulleken’s Ultra Processed People, I am sure, was not supposed to be a horror story – but it is.

In his jaw-dropping exposure to Ultra-processed food, from how they are produced to how they were created, I had plenty of moments where I had to re-read sections due to being horrified, gob-smacked, and seriously worried, as a medical professional, mother and individual.

From the Nestle Boat (If you haven’t heard of this, definitely look it up and be prepared to be shocked), ice-cream, bread, crisps, (I could go on!) learning about how these “foods” trick our clever body, become addictive, affect our gut and microbiome, and our brain health left me looking at the supermarkets, and my choices in a new way.

Of course, it is not as simple as stopping buying premade pizza.

Dr Chris van Tulleken explains and understands the socio-economic impact of ultra-processed foods and how, sadly, these are affordable to low-income households.

There is no choice for some people, and this is shameful.
Dr Chris van Tulleken explores the colossal devastation on the rainforests that producing Ultra-processed food has, as well as how it is scarily replacing indigenous/cultural meals.

He speaks to industry experts, uncovering how teams of scientists work on these “foods”, as well as medics who are dealing with the real-life health consequences of these “foods” being consumed.

This is a must-read/listen – take in the information and fight back wherever possible.

This is THE diet and nutrition book to read.

I know that I am changed for the better with this knowledge, and I am teaching my children so that they grow into adults fully aware of food and “food”.
