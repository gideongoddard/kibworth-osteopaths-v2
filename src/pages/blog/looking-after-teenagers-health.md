Young adults are an interesting demographic; often, their minds are more advanced than their physical bodies – did you know that the pelvis remains in 3 parts, not fusing into 1 until we are 15?

Coping with teenagers can challenge even the calmest of parents. We need to remember that their physical body is a changing area which can cause symptoms.

In this piece, I discuss the most common things I see in teenagers as an Osteopath.

The key thing is if you are worried about your teenager’s health (be it physical or mental), reach out for professional help.

### Hormonal Changes

Hormonal surges can cause a wonderful array of things, including growth.

Growing pains, however, are not caused by growth – their cause remains unknown. Growing pains usually affect both legs and are mainly felt at night.

This is often described as an aching or throbbing in the leg muscles. NOT the joints.

They are more common in very flexible children and more active children.

Gentle massage and applying heat to the throbbing areas can alleviate the pain. It is important that if you are concerned, you see your GP with your child.

### Osgood-Schlatter’s

Physical activity is really important for teenagers (as it is for all of us!) We all know the benefits of taking part in sports and activities.

Sadly, sometimes Osgood-Schlatter’s can occur in really sporty kids. This is felt as pain in the knee (one or both) and is usually felt after taking part in high-impact sport.

This is probably the most common issue I see in the teenage demographic, and it is vital careful management by a professional is in place.

Ice packs and specific stretches, as well as periods of rest, are the initial stages of calming Osgood-Schlatter’s down.

As with adults, teenagers must warm up and cool down before/after sport as well.

### School Bags

Whilst there is no evidence to suggest that the weight of a bag is linked to spinal pain or discomfort, teenagers often like to have bags on one shoulder or the straps low.

Now, you don’t need to be an Osteopath to see how those 2 scenarios can potentially irritate the body.

Items such as lunch bags, a PE kit, and perhaps a musical instrument mean that our kids (in the absence of school lockers) often have a lot to lug about. And this can be a bulky load, often carried outside the centre of gravity.

Adding this load to the bodies developing structure, for a walk to school, around school, and back from school (often 5 times a week!) can irritate and inflame.

Especially if bags are on one shoulder – making rucksacks an absolute must, with the straps tight enough to ensure the bag is not halfway down their legs!

### Phones and Tablets

Phones and tablets are a big issue. The term ‘text neck’ or ‘tech neck’ is now an everyday ‘diagnosis’ for me in the clinic. 
Kids of all ages are now digitally native, and they need to be for their future.

Just watch that they don’t have their necks in too much flexion (think chin to chest) – as this places a lot of strain on the neck which can lead to discomfort, tight muscles and headaches.

With the chin pointing down, this places 5 times the head's weight through the discs in our neck.

Regular technology breaks are key (I know this can be a battle) so that the head, neck and eyes have a break. A good rule here (for us all) is 20-20-20.

Look away from your screen every 20 minutes for 20 seconds at something 20 yards away.

### Studying, Homework & Exam Stress

Studying and Exam stress are not easy to navigate.

Exam revision, more often than not, places kids in a static position looking down reading/writing – under pressure for prolonged periods.

This can place strain on the neck and shoulder muscles, which could cause tightness and pain, which potentially leads to headaches.

Regular breaks are key, as well as ensuring kids are studying at a table where possible (not their bed).

When teenagers are studying, the advice for sitting posture is that they ideally have an office chair that is adjustable, their bottom is at the back of the chair, and their spines sit back into their chair (headrests are not great on study chairs).

If your teen is petite, it may be a footrest is needed to help prevent them from sitting on the edge of the chair.

If your teen is taller, often they slouch as this means they have less ‘lean in their necks’ – a document holder is useful here.

Studying is close-focus work, so try and encourage the 20-20-20 habit.

A document holder can be brilliant for holding books/notes in a more upright position, keeping the head and neck in a better position.

Encourage your child to have at least an hour of physical activity daily and maintain their team sports/hobbies in exam season – even going out for a walk gives their physical body a break and their mind.

### Hydration Helps

Ensuring that enough water is drunk can be yet another battleground!

For adolescent females 14 years plus, the advice is 2 litres per day. For adolescent males, this is 2.5 litres of water per day (in line with advice from the British Nutrition Foundation).

There are many influencing factors, such as activity levels, climate, and body weight; this is just a general guide.

For more information on water intake in teenagers, I advise visiting Hydration - British Nutrition Foundation. As our body is 70% water, we must keep hydrated to recommended guidelines.

Water is so important. Some roles of water include the transportation of nutrients around the body.

It is used in many body chemical reactions, and temperature regulation moistens the eyes, nose and mouth.

Drinking the appropriate amount of water helps energise your muscles and helps us feel more awake/alert. Water is the main component of synovial fluid which helps lubricate joints.
