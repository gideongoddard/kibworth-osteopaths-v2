As many of you know, my expertise is the amazing physical body.

From diagnosing to treating and rehabilitating injuries, I love it all!

Did you know that I am also a mental health first aider? Our physical and mental bodies intertwine, interplay, and interact so intrinsically that we must consider both when considering winter and how to do it well.

But why is it essential to ‘Winter Well’? Surely we just need to get our heads down, trudge on and endure the dark and cold? That does not sound nice – or fun- in any way!

Our physical body still needs to be moved and considered.

Often, I look to nature for the answer. Although nature looks dormant over winter, a lot is happening underground.

Seeds are keeping safe and warm for next spring, and nature takes a well-earned rest after the growth in spring, the abundance of summer, and the harvest of autumn.

We need to do the same—but in balance; I rest my mind over winter but keep my physical body moving. 

### Physically

I often hear in the clinic that when it is cold, my patients are in more pain or old niggles surface.

In winter, our muscles can shorten against the cold to retain heat (fun fact: this is why we shiver – our muscles generate heat for the body).

However, on cold grey days, we are generally less active.

This can be for genuine reasons, such as dangerous weather (frosts with ice, for example), but even in these conditions, there is still an opportunity to wrap up and go for a shorter, slower walk.

If you really cannot safely get out, march on the spot in the house (provided you are safe to do so) and keep moving little and often throughout the day. Your body needs movement just as much in the winter as in the warmer seasons.

If you are an outdoor exerciser, you may consider a winter gym membership. You can also move your exercise time to times of the day when there is daylight. Ensure your clothing is suitable - my website has [a blog about this](/blog/staying-fit-in-colder-weather/).

I recently wrote about [the importance of a good pair of winter boots](/blog/boots/), so we have the ground contact sorted. Getting your clothing right is essential — you can always take layers off!

Always remember the value of a scarf and hat. And if your hands get cold (and then, like mine, really hurt), wear gloves — especially if you know you are going to be out for a while.

### Nutrition

There are SO many tempting treats around this time of year, and a little indulgence here and there is okay!

Try to maintain a balanced, healthy diet. The positive effect of good, nutritious food on the physical body and your mind (there is a whole blog right there) is well-researched—trust me, you will always feel better after a homemade casserole than a greasy takeaway.

Finally, you still need to keep your hydration levels up!

Yes, we sweat less in the winter, but that does not mean we don’t need to drink water.

It is easy to let this slip when it is cold, but your body is still 70% water in the winter and summer. Stick to recommended guidelines (these can be found on the NHS website).

### Mentally

A wintering of the mind can truthfully happen any time of the year. I recommend the excellent book “Wintering” by Katherine May for a more detailed explanation. See my book review [here](https://kibworthosteopaths.co.uk/blog/book-review-wintering/).

But, in addition to all well-meant tips and advice, we do need to be aware that SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) is a very real experience for many people.

If you feel you need professional help with your mental health, reach out to your GP and be honest about how you are feeling. There is no shame in needing support with your mental health, whatever your age.

The rest of my tips for mentally wintering well come from my knowledge as a mental health first aider and the little things that help me.

Earlier, I mentioned taking a mental break over winter – I call this a “brain break”. This means I don’t push myself to learn complicated things over winter, but I still ensure that I stimulate myself mentally. It also includes cooking up delicious winter warmers in Casa Coombes, reading that book I have had on my shelf all year, and trying my hand at some craft.

### Christmas Joy?

My biggest tip for keeping your mental health in check over winter is regarding the madness that can surround Christmas.

The pressure can be on to be here, there, and everywhere, all glammed up and ready to party. If this is your scene – go for it!

If, however, you are like me and feel the call to rest and recoup – say NO to things that deep down you have zero desire to attend. You don’t have to participate in every event unless YOU want to.

### Quick Tips

I love to wear something bright on grey days – it always lifts my mood.

I arrange meet-ups with friends for a coffee to keep me from staying inside all weekend, and if we can’t get out due to the weather, we video call instead.

I keep up my physical exercise routine of running, walking and Pilates.

I always do one random act of kindness in the winter whenever I am out—it doesn’t have to cost money—even putting litter in a bin counts. Being kind to someone or our planet always leaves me with a warm glow, and I am pretty sure that is contagious in a good way!

Wishing you a winter of wellness!
