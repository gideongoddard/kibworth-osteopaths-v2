- **Do you often feel you can’t say no?**
- **Are you spread too thin between your relationships and your responsibilities?**
- **Is there never time to do the things that matter to you?**

In their book “Boundaries”, Jennie Miller and Victoria Lambert explore how and why we should have clear boundaries and their benefits. 

Boundaries need to be different for varied areas of life, and this book discusses how to set them in our personal life, work life and with ourselves. All of which seek to improve our mental well-being.

Increasingly boundaries are overstepped, blurred and not respected. This book will help you to value your boundaries and your time.
