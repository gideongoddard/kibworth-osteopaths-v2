<h2>Let's dispel some myths about exercising whilst pregnant...</h2>

Being pregnant is an amazing yet physically tough experience, and lots of people think that they cannot continue exercising. This is not necessarily true (there are medical exemptions of course). The American College of Sports Medicine recommend that pregnant ladies can do 150 minutes a week of cardio, and the Royal College of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians recommend exercise sessions are kept to 45 minute sessions.

It is about adapting exercise to keep you, and the baby safe. Exercise can deliver profound benefits physically, mentally and emotionally for pregnant patients. So talk to me about your concerns if you are pregnant and want to carry on with sports.

Being an Osteopath gives me the skills to look after pregnant patients with lots of hands on help, and I am qualified to teach Pre and Postnatal Pilates.
