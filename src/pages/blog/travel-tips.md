Holidays are the best. Whether you are a cruiser, camper, or a jetsetter, to get anywhere you are going to be travelling. 
However you travel, and wherever you are going, if you have a sore neck which has taken an age to find the right pillow that keeps your neck happy meaning you do not wake up in pain – take your pillow with you!

I would also advise you to travel in trainers. You are likely to be doing an amount of walking during the process of travelling (especially airports).

Trainers are designed to keep your feet comfortable, supported, and help the knees, hips, and lower back. 
Flipflops or high heels are the worst travel companion – especially if for any reason you need to move quickly. Do also keep hydrated – if nothing else your bladder at least will keep you moving!

Biofreeze roll on is a great travel buddy – this product is safe for most people to use – if you are not sure check with your pharmacist.

I recommend this a lot for injury cooling. It is great over those troublesome niggles as it helps limit inflammatory build up (which can happen when we are sat crammed in for prolonged periods of time). Most pharmacies will sell this – or THAT online shop that sells everything.

<h3>Tips for flying</h3>

Hate it or love it, flying is the quickest way of getting overseas. It can fill many of my patients with the worry that the flight will aggravate their back (or shoulder/hip/knee) and potentially spoil their holiday. Hopefully these top tips below help:

- <strong>Walk</strong> – get up and move where possible. I appreciate this is not always easy – especially if the random person you are sitting next to is fast asleep, but where you can, have a walk on the plane. In between this, doing some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fb.watch/eaY5xWAAMU/">whole body simple seated exercises</a> can be helpful.
- <strong>Carousel</strong> – You have arrived at your destination, and you see your case on the carousel. Do not be tempted to reach and grab your case in a twisting action – this is likely to pull your lower back, and /or your shoulder. Wait until you are directly in front of your case and then retrieve it. Do make use of airport trolleys if your case does not have wheels.

Do not spend 2 weeks lying on a sun lounger - this will most likely cause your lower back to really complain. Yes, rest, relax, recline, and enjoy your well earned break.

But do remain active, put those trainers on and explore your destination. If you can swim, get in the sea (where it is safe to do so) or pool. If you are not a confident swimmer or if you are rehabilitating an injury, walking in water is a fantastic way to build up joint and muscle strength.

<h3>Tips for long car journeys</h3>

Break them up – national guidelines are every 90 minutes. This does not mean doing a full body workout in a service station car park.

Get out of your vehicle, have a small walk 2-5 minutes is great, and then continue. Travelling with small children or dogs will absolutely guarantee you take this break.

Try not to be crammed in – loading the car is a real-life version of Tetris. Do not lose driver or passenger space to luggage.

Firstly, it is dangerous. Secondly, it could mean you or your passengers are sitting at an awkward angle meaning their posture is compromised.

If you are camping, make sure you have a good and supportive camp bed / air mattress. It really does make all the difference to your body from head to toe.

<h3>Tips for a cruise</h3>

During your days at sea make sure you walk around the boat to keep your steps up.

My biggest top tips for your holiday? Wear sunscreen, make memories, and have a blast.
