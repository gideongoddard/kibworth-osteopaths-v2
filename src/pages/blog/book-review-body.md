As an Osteopath, I specialise in the bio-mechanics of the beautiful human body. I am the eternal student of the body, an absolute privilege.

My book reviews are written to help you better understand and nurture your physical body. I hope you enjoy reading them, and if you have any books to suggest, I would be very interested to [hear about them](mailto:info@kibworthosteopaths.co.uk).

### Book Review: Body, James Davies.

---

*"James developed the ethos of Heal, Reset and Restore based on his own experience of injury, which cut short a promising career in athletics. Since then, James' mission has been to help everyone learn about how their body works, understand why they are in pain, and how to reach full health using his proven strategies. James' ethos is that 'Anything is Possible’."*

I had the privilege of training at University with James Davies – even before we qualified, James’ passion for the body was second to none.

In his book, Body, James talks the reader through ways of helping self-help.

He provides fantastic tips on rehabilitation for specific mechanical injuries and how to know when you need to seek professional help. This book is a great resource that you will turn to for years.
