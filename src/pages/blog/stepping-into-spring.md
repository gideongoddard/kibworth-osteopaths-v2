### Osteopaths care about all of you, from the top of your head to the tips of your toes.

It’s almost time to remove those trusty winter boots and step into lighter footwear - thank goodness!

It can be tempting to choose fashionable footwear. However, this is often not the best environment for our feet (often, the shoes look nothing like our feet, which I always find odd), especially if our feet are sore, arthritic, or suffering from an injury.

I always look at my patients' shoes—they tell me so much about them.

I can get an insight into how they walk and weight-bear and whether they weight-bear equally through their legs.

You can tell a lot from looking at shoes—check if one shoe is more worn than the other, as well as if the shoe is right for you.

For example, is the shoe fitting correctly and the other not? Are they even comfortable?

All feet are different. Some people have high arches, some have flat arches, some have narrow feet, and others are wide.

What all feet have in common is that they are biomechanical marvels. The foot has 26 bones, 33 joints, and over 100 ligaments, muscles, and tendons. It takes the weight of the body all day and absorbs ground force as we move.

With this in mind it is only fair that we give our feet an excellent environment to work in.

I remember a long time ago, one of my elderly patients told me that he was advised by his father (so we are going back here), “Never skimp on footwear or mattresses, because if you’re not in one, you’re on the other”.

Wearing the ‘wrong shoe’ can lead to a host of problems throughout the body. From foot and knee pain to lower back pain and tight and sore muscles in the legs, the consequences can be far-reaching.

### What about Barefoot Shoes?

I commonly get asked about barefoot shoes in the clinic. I can absolutely see the merits of them in terms of allowing the feet freedom to move and not being crammed into shoes, and the thinner sole (after some months) of wearing them does encourage the foot to strengthen – simply because the shoe isn’t doing all the work for the foot.

Research also shows that being barefoot or wearing barefoot-style shoes improves balance, which is essential, especially as we age.

Research also shows that barefoot shoes are suitable for young, developing feet and improving balance and motor skills.

If barefoot shoes are something you want to try – the advice is to go slowly.

It takes time to transition into something new for the muscles to wake up and work in a way they haven’t had to for many generations.

I am going to try a pair and see how I get on – so watch this space for some feedback!

## My top tips with footwear

### Active footwear

There is an absolutely overwhelming amount of choice and information about what is ‘right’ for your feet.

Did you know that when jogging became popular, there was a huge increase in lower extremity injuries?

This was when trainers became chunky on the heel. Because the population had been in dress shoes for so long, the Achilles and leg muscles were shortened.

When it comes to trainers, I recommend getting them properly fitted in a sports shop, where your gait (how you walk and weight bear) can be adequately assessed.

Wearing the wrong trainers on your feet for sports can predispose you to injury. Those aesthetically pleasing kicks may not be feet-pleasing – so choose what is suitable for your feet, not your eyes!

A word on Barefoot trainers for running: If you want to try them, build them up slowly. Decrease your distance and get used to them before you start racking up the miles.

### Office footwear

This is a big one. High heels - especially stiletto heels - are just hideous for feet. When we wear them, our weight is thrown forward, causing the muscles at the back of the body to shorten and become tight.

This, in turn, can cause lower back pain as the joints can sit closer together.

Even sitting in heels causes the calf muscles and Achilles tendon to shorten, which can lead to ankle dysfunction.

Pointy shoes are again a no for me. This style of shoe is literally a house of horrors for your feet and predisposes to bunions – and who would invite these in?!

### Out and about footwear

Pick the shoe for the job!

Trainers or a trainer-type shoe are best for an active day out.

Sometimes, we “need” a dressy shoe (think weddings)—avoid pointy shoes and mega heels (car to bar is a scrape of a pass from me). 
If they are new, wear them in before their big outing.

As the weather warms, it is tempting to reach for those flip flops - so maybe check out my thoughts on those [here](/blog/flipflops-are-a-flop/).
